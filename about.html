<p>We believe the debt, stress, clutter and waste of materialism and consumerism are really detrimental to the quality of our lives.  At the same time, we like the "good stuff", as they say.  So, now what?</p>

<p>While everyone must find the balance that's right for them, we try to adopt a philosophy we call 5 Star Mininalism.  In other words, we try to only acquire things that we truly need (which is a lot less than we think) or that will genuinely enrich our lives.</p>

<p>We believe the things in our lives should enrich them, not add clutter, debt and stress to them.  For what it's worth, we call this 5 Star Miniimalism.</p>

<p>While there is an abundance of consumer goods out there-- let's face it. Much of it is poorly-made, poorly-designed, or so inexpensive that if it doesnt meet expectations, we just buy another one and build clutter around us.  Such things don't really give us the benefits and value we expect for our money.</p>
